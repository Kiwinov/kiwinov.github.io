I'm an engineering undergrad from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. 

I love working on challenging problems.
My interest in math and machine learning drives my career choices of late.

I'm currently building StrInt: an AI-powered tool to do the gruntwork for Structural Engineers, allowing them to focus on creative and higher-value tasks.

## Previous Experiences

Last summer I interned at [Fractal AI Research](https://fractal.ai/ai-research), where I worked on Diffusion and Reward Models.

Before that I had been engaged as a Student Researcher in the intersection of AI and HCI at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) in Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

I also worked in an early stage deep-tech startup, [Dirac Labs](https://diraclabs.com) for almost an entire year, taking up various responsibilities including ML Engineering, Research and Founder's Office Operations.

I am also an [Emergent Ventures](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/11/emergent-ventures-india-13th-cohort.html) grantee.

## More about me
I love reading books (horror and sci-fi are my favorites), jamming to music (love Eden!) and playing videogames (Deltarune ftw!) in my past-time.

I'm also deeply interested in socioeconomic systems and AI (duh) 

I hope to write some blogs here about the latter two soon!

Here is a list of some of the restaurants I've visited in Bangalore, along with my thoughts on them. 

This serves to be more of a personal note than a blog, but hey, if it helps others its great!

## 1. Brik Oven - Church Street, Indiranagar
Best pizzas I've eaten, hands down. There's nothing like it. The pork pizzas taste great and are a must try. The ice teas are pretty nice too.

The restaurant itself is small and cozy, the servers are friendly and the food is served hot. It sits right in the middle of Church Street making it an easy visit.

## 2. Maffei Kitchen - Kora
Great place for middle-eastern cuisine. There's hummus with all sorts of toppings and really good chicken-based dishes.

It is somewhat expensive but the food is worth it.

## 3. Burma Burma - Orion
Very interesting food (Burmese cuisine), really liked it. The Baos were really tasty and the noodles-based dishes were very unique.
It warrants multiple visits to try out other things. 

It is, however, quite expensive.

## 4. Bombay Brasserie - Orion
The best North Indian food I've eaten in my life. Absolutely worth it and is in my regular go-tos now.

They have a musician over in the weekend, turning it very cosy.

## 5. Grub Monkeys - New Bel Road
It's a 1980s American themed restaurant. 
Great food, really good portions and an amazing music taste.

It's tucked away below the ground, I had never seen it before my friend had suggested it.

## 6. Toscano - UB City
Great ambience with a musician on the weekends, good Italian food.

## 7. Chianti - Manyata Tech Park
They promised us a discount but never gave it :(. 

Bruschettas here are great. Not many people here though, maybe it's because of the SOCIAL next to it.

## 8. Shiv Sagar - Mantri
Very typical South Indian food, great to take your parents (if they are South Indian). 
Somewhat overpriced but it's in a mall, so it is expected.

## 9. Barbeque by Punjab Grill - Mantri Mall
Typical Indian buffet, the food is as expected and the price is reasonable.

## 10. AB's Barbeque - Yelahanka
Went to this place in the noon. One of the best barbeque places I've been to, all the options are great - starters, main courses, desserts. 

It is very cheap on the weekdays.

<!-- ## 11. Coal Barbeque - Velachery, Chennai
Very cheap on weekends from 4PM to 6PM (450 rupees from what I remember).
Good food.

## 12. Barbeque Nation - Manyata Tech Park, PVR Grand Velachery, Chennai
Highly variable between branches. It is better than Coal Barbeques but worse than AB's. -->
